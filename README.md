# Asynchronous-Hit-Detection
Processes the hit packets sent from the client to the server asynchronously, there are many ways to do this however this is the method I've chose to be the most efficient.
Big credits to @Retrooper https://www.github.com/retrooper for the packetevents project which makes this project easier and better laid out.
